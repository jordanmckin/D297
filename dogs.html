                <p class="text_content">The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of
                    choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a
                    dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a
                    companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show
                    medical indicators such as <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">reduced blood pressure and improved
                        lipid profiles.</a> If you have a dog, it
                    is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and
                    provide enough opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more information about how to
                    care for your pets throughout the various stages of their lives. </p>
                <p class="text_content_bold">Diet & Exercise</p>
                <p class="text_content">Throughout dogs lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they
                    mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when
                    they are about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per
                    day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one
                    year old. And a dogs typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water.
                    The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can
                    cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!</p>
                <p class="text_content">Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their
                    organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies
                    greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range of 30â€“120 minutes of exercise is
                    recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother
                    some of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising
                    your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You
                    can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age
                    appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require
                    supervision.</p>
                <p class="text_content_bold">Grooming & Handling</p>
                <p class="text_content">Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to
                    brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove
                    to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after
                    visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dogs health but can be an
                    exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse <strong>all</strong> of the soap out, as
                    any residual soap
                    can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can
                    cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the
                    size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then
                    cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a
                    large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to
                    support the chest and rear as you lift.</p>
            
            <p class="text_content_bold">Vaccinations & Medications</p>
            <p class="text_content">You should <strong>always</strong> consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of
                vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as
                hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in
                which the dog resides. Some of these include <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and
                Leptospira bacteria.</a></p>
